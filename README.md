# LPOO_25 Ghost Rumble (GR)

> Ghost Rumble (or GR for short) is a survival arena combat game, in which the player must survive as long as he can inside a mysterious haunted house, filled with ghosts and other spooky creatures that will chase him down and may harm him. :skull: :ghost: 

> The game lasts as long as the player is able to survive and overcome the monsters, by dodging and shooting them. If he lets the enemies get too close and touch him, his health will be lowered; the game ends when the player's HP drops to 0.
